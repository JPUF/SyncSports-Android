`MainActivity()`

The underlying Activity class.

This activity hosts all other fragments, which are responsible for displaying each individual screen. As can be seen in activity_main.xml, this MainActivity simply has a singular 'NavHostFragment' which controls the currently visible Fragment, via the Navigation component.
